# Kenya External Debt Forecasting with ARIMA

This project uses a time series forecasting model to predict Kenya's total external debt stocks for the years 2023‚Äì2026, based on historical data from 2013 to 2022.

## üìä Project Overview

The dataset (`Kenya.csv`) contains annual external debt indicators for Kenya. We focus specifically on the **"Total External Debt Stocks"** metric and apply an **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model to forecast future values.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing metadata rows and formatting columns.
2. **Time Series Construction**: Structuring the data with time-based indices.
3. **Visualization**: Plotting historical data.
4. **Modeling**: Fitting an ARIMA(1,1,1) model to capture trends.
5. **Forecasting**: Predicting external debt values for 2023‚Äì2026.
6. **Visualization of Forecast**: Displaying the future projection alongside historical data.
